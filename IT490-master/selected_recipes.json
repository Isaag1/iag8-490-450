      "Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the milk mixture, stir, and let sit in a warm place for about 10 minutes until the yeast has bloomed.",

      "Generously butter 2 9-inch (23 cm) round baking pans and set aside.",

      "Knead the dough for at least 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface or your hands. The dough should be very smooth and spring back when poked.",

      "Using unflavored dental floss, cut the log into evenly pieces, about 1½ inches (8cm) thick. Place the cinnamon rolls in the prepared pans, 1 in the center and about 5 around the sides. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 35-45 minutes, until expanded by about half of their original volume. If you’re saving the cinnamon rolls for later, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for up 3 months.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).",
      "Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.",
      "While the cinnamon rolls are baking, make the frosting: In a medium bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, melted butter, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar and whisk until homogenous and runny.",
      "When the cinnamon rolls are finished, let cool for about 10 minutes.",
      "Drizzle the frosting over the cinnamon rolls, using the back of a spoon to spread if desired.",
