<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Mention the Vendors you explored and some pros/cons for each that affected your decision</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The two vendors that I decided to check into were between Azure and<br>Google. Those have their own services called Azure virtual Machines and Google Compute<br>Engine. One pro for GCE was&nbsp;they offer $300 in free credit for new<br>users and extra $100 for students &amp; all customers get a general purpose<br>machine (e2-micro instance) per month for free. A con for Azure from what<br>I can find was to run two VM&#39;s, it would be $274.48&nbsp; monthly.<br>When it comes to using Ubuntu, there is documentation for GCE stating, &quot;Run<br>your choice of OS, including Debian, CentOS Stream, Fedora CoreOS, SUSE, and Ubuntu.&quot;<br>This is a pro because it is what we are looking for. Azure<br>also supports ubuntu. Another positive is they both allow you to access root<br>and also allow you to change firewall settings. One negative i&#39;ve seen while<br>researching GCE was that many say it is complex to use and takes<br>time to get used to. Another con I saw was that integration with<br>third-party tools and services can be limited.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Which vendor option did you go with and why?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I went with the Google Compute Engine because it offered a lot of<br>helpful resourecs and documentation for help. It also had many tutorials on youtube<br>that helped with any issues I had. A big reason too was the<br>$400 we each get to use per account. It gave us a rough<br>estimate that it would take about $27 a month running our instance but<br>having $400 is more then enough and gave us safety and kept us<br>calm knowing we have a lot of time to work with.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> How do you plan to manage your usage quota? (Also mention the quota)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The quota usage limit for Google Comput Engine is about 1000 queries per<br>day. I plan to manage this by working with my group and making<br>sure we all participate and contribute so none of us meet the limit.<br>Google can have restricts so once you meet the queries limit, it restricts<br>you. It also had a page that displays all types of information like<br>quota usage and also how much of the free trial we have left.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What issues did you face and how did you resolve them?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I struggled for a while trying to clone my repo from github on<br>the virtual machine but I got it figured out when I relized I<br>had yet to do the eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot; command. After that I faced<br>another issue but I was able to figure it out because GCE would<br>show a different screen after updating and upgrading or installing new things but<br>you would just have to change pages.<br></p><br></td></tr>
